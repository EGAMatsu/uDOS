uDOS which stands for Unified Data Operation System. A system whose primary goal
is to provide an opensource system for documenting S390X architectures - in
order to promote hobby operating systems on this obscure archtiecture.

A list of goals is provided below:
- Multiarchitecture
- Monolhitic modular kernel
- JCL interpreter out-of-box; integrated tightly with the system
- Integration with graphical windows management systems
- NetKernel-only operation (no graphical user interface and pure networking)
- POSIX ports
- UDI integration with the kernel
- RAM and CPU hot(un)plugging on the run

uDOS uses autotools as the main build system generator because it's very based

In order to generate the configuration scripts you only need to run:
"autoreconf"

Use "./configure --host=s390-linux --target=s390-linux" in order to configure
for a MVS-compatible target.

You'll need make, hercules and dasd-utils (they come with hercules by default).

In order to run the system just do:
"./run.sh"
